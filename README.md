# My project
*FLAME DETECTOR
*description*
fire accident are the major cause in every day life which harms buildings and also human
beings. So in this project we will use flame sensor to discover the presence of fire using infrared flame flash
technique before Fire start chaos. So when Arduino receives this signals it will respond by ringing the buzzer as the form of warning to the environment as fire detection for evacuation and rescue.
